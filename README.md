# student_mangment_system
This project is a simple student enrollment and fee management system. It allows students to register by providing their name, degree (B.TECH or M.TECH), and branch. The system generates a unique student ID, manages tuition fees based on the chosen branch, and facilitates payment of outstanding fees.
